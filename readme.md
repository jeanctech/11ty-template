## Introduction

Welcome to [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)! This is your very first post. Check [documentation](https://hexo.io/docs/) for more info. If you get any problems when using Hexo, you can find the answer in [troubleshooting](https://hexo.io/docs/troubleshooting.html) or you can ask me on [GitHub](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/issues).

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial objective of the project. And after that I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that for the moment it can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

* As soon as the course continues, I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
